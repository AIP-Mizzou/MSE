# MSE and PSNR Code
Use this code to calculate MSE and PSNR values for two images. You may just copy the MSE function itself and integrate it into your own code, which relies only on Numpy. Or, you can call [MSE.py](./MSE.py) to calculate and display the values.

# Example Usage
`python MSE.py ABQ.tif ABQ_20pNoise.tif`

Output:
```
MSE: 3847
PSNR: 12.2794
```
